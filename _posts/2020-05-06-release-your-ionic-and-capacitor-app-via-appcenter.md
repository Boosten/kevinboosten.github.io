Building and deploying mobile applications can be challenging.
I like developing mobile applications for iOS and Android. My framework of choice to do this is [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)! Now Capacitor became the preferred way to access your native SDK's in your hybrid app, building apps with AppCenter became a lot easier!

If you're building a hybrid application with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), you probably are using [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/) as your native bridge to get access to API's like your camera, push notifications and others. If you're not using it yet then you should definitely give it a try!

> _Capacitor is a spiritual successor to Apache Cordova and Adobe PhoneGap, with inspiration from other popular cross-platform tools like React Native and Turbolinks, but focused entirely on enabling modern web apps to run on all major platforms with ease. Capacitor has backwards-compatible support for many existing Cordova plugins._

Check out the [Capacitor docs](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/) for a brief introduction!

## AppCenter

Visual Studio AppCenter is a Microsoft product for continuously build, test, release and monitor your apps. In this article we're only going to focus on the building part of AppCenter.
AppCenter supports a variety of operating systems: iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS and even tvOS. The platforms, besides the native ones, that are available are: React Native, Cordova (preview), Xamarin and Unity. Enough to cover your needs, I guess!

### Ionic AppFlow

Of course there'r e alternatives to build you mobile application. If you're primarily building Ionic applications then [Ionic AppFlow](https://ionicframework.com/appflow) will maybe be the better choice for you. They also have got 'Publishing to Store' functionality since a couple of months!
But if you're working in a company that also builds Xamarin and React Native apps, then AppCenter makes more sense.

## Create a test app

> Skip this section if you already have an Ionic+Capacitor app

So let's start with creating a Ionic + Capacitor app so we can use that as our app that we're going to use in AppCenter.

You can also fork this demo application from [GitHub](https://github.com/Boosten/ionic-capacitor-appcenter-demo).

First install the Ionic CLI

```bash
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

Create an Angular application with Capacitor integration. At this point we just have a normal Angular web application, nothing special so far!

```bash
ionic start myApp tabs --capacitor --type=angular
cd myApp
```

Start the application to verify everything went well

```bash
ionic serve
```

Okay, you should now see a tabbed application with some dummy data in it.

Let's add the native platforms to it. In order to do this, we should have at least build our application once, so run:

```
ionic build
```

Add the native platforms after that:

```
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
```

Push your changes to a (private) repository and you are good to go!

## Configuring AppCenter

We're now going to create an app in AppCenter and connect it to our repository.

1. Go to AppCenter to create a new application: <https://appcenter.ms/apps>
   ![img](/assets/images/posts/2020-05-06/1.png)

1. Enter a name for your application, select iOS en choose a release type. The release type is just a label and it does not have any affect on your build.

1. Select **Build** from the side-menu and connect your git repo.

   ![img](/assets/images/posts/2020-05-06/4.png)

1. Now click on the branch that you would like to configure for building (or click on the wrench icon). And click on **Configure**
   ![img](/assets/images/posts/2020-05-06/5.png)

   ![img](/assets/images/posts/2020-05-06/6.png)

1. It's possible that you see the error _You must add a shared scheme_. Follow the instructions in the link to set your workspace scheme to "Shared".
   Also add the necessary Provisioning Profile and Certificate to build a valid `.ipa` file.

   > _In case you forked the demo repo, you need to change the Team ID and App ID in XCode manually and push these changes to your fork. Also provide a provisioning profile and certificate that matches your app._

   You can also change other settings like building on each push and auto incrementing your build number.

   Now click on Save & Build to see what happens!

1. ‚ùå That escalated quickly!
   What happened? Remember we are trying to build a hybrid application? So what did we do to actually build the web part of the app?
   ![img](/assets/images/posts/2020-05-06/8.png)

1. And here comes the 'trick' üí°!
   Let's add a file `appcenter-post-clone.sh` to the iOS (_ios/App/appcenter-post-clone.sh_) and Android (_android/app/appcenter-post-clone.sh_) projects.

   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash

   # fail if any command fails
   set -e
   # debug log
   set -x

   # Required nodeJS version
   NODE_VERSION=10.17.0

   # workaround to override the v8 alias
   npm config delete prefix
   . ~/.bashrc
   nvm install "$NODE_VERSION"
   nvm alias node10 "$NODE_VERSION"

   # go to root of project
   cd ../..

   # install dependencies
   npm i

   # run optimized production build
   npm run build -- --prod

   # copy the web assets to the native projects and updates the native plugins and dependencies based in package.json
   npx cap sync
   ```

   The first couple of lines are just to override the default NodeJS version that AppCenter is using.
   After that, we're installing our npm dependencies, running an production build and finally invoking a Capacitor specific command to sync the projects.

   Go back to the configuration and be sure to click on "Save & Build" button to let App Center know that new build specific files need to be indexed.

   Your build should now succeed after waiting for a couple of minutes üéâ.

## Conclusion

So, long story short: add the `appcenter-post-clone.sh` script to both native projects in your Ionic + Capacitor project, and you will be able to use App Center as your CI/CD platform!

You obviously can extend this script with all the things you need. For example: you could change the dev/prod mode based on a `environment variable` that you can set in your App Center build configuration. Definitely take a look at the [Microsoft sample-build-scripts repo](https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter/tree/master/sample-build-scripts).

### Next steps?

- Extend your build configuration to your needs
- Distribute builds to distribution groups
- Publish your application to the public stores

Happy building üèóüë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è!
